# Summary

[![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/mkellsy/reprap-delta.svg?colorB=%23999999&label=updated&logo=github&logoColor=%2364b5f6&style=popout-square)](https://github.com/mkellsy/reprap-delta)

The default corner mounts that come with the K280 are good, however I see that they made one part work for the top and bottom. This causes issues with both the top and bottom mounts. The timing pulley on the top is too loose, it can creep back and forward causing distortion in prints.

The bottom mounts are near impossible to secure all 4 M3 screws into the steppers. I actually had to re-tap the steppers to fix the threads.

I created 3 separate parts, designed to securely mount the steppers and pulleys to the frame. The top has longer mount points, that prevents the pulley from moving laterally. The bottom corners are split into 2 parts. A corner mount, this simply holds the frame together. The second is a stepper mount that secures to the outer corner mount.

The two piece bottom mount allows you to mount the steppers before installing into the printer. This is a far more precise and rigid design than the original.
